# Please view the video follow_hand_demo_290716 for a demonstration of the starting process.

# Terminal 1
  rosclean purge -y
  roscore

# Terminal 2
# Start the server on Linux for Windows Machine to publish the Perception Neuron states
  $ rosrun rosserial_server socket_node

# On Windows Machine
  Start Perception Neuron GUI ("Axis Neuron x64.exe")
  Put on and connect the suit
  Check in the settings of the "Axis Neuron x64.exe" to enable broadcasting of positions
  Open "config.txt" in "perception-neuron-ros-master_b12"->"windows"
  Write the IP-adress of your ROS and windows machine.
  Start PerceptioNeuronROSserial.exe
    Maybe restart it

# Terminal 3
# Start the UR10 simulation
  $ roslaunch tum_ics_ur10_bringup bringUR10.launch

# Terminal 3
  # Only for use with a real robot, builds a connection between the robot and the ROS machine
    $ roslaunch tum_ics_ur_robot_manager robot_script_manager_ur10.launch

#Terminal 4
  # For simulation
      $ roslaunch tum_ics_ur_robot_controllers testJointCtrl_ur10.launch

  # Real Robot (WARNING THE ROBOT IS NOW ACTIVE AND LISTENING TO THE TOPIC /joint_desired_cmd)
  # HAND in the red button, EYES on the robot!!!
      $ roslaunch tum_ics_ur_robot_controllers testJointCtrl_ur10.launch ROBOT:=real

# Terminal 5
# Start to publish the data from the Rosserial_server to tf
  $ rosrun perc_neuron_tf_broadcaster perc_neuron_tf_broadcaster_node

#Terminal 6
# Start the main program to transfer the tf data from the Perception Neuron onto the robot.
  $ roslaunch follow_hand ur5_perc.launch
